Non-MVP Backlog (Defer Until Core Creator Flow Is Excellent)
Date: 2026-02-14

Rule
- If a feature does not improve first-time publish, fast editing, or preview confidence, defer it.

Deferred features
- Advanced analytics dashboards beyond basic publish/use metrics
- Recommendation engines / personalized discovery feeds
- Complex collaboration and role permissions
- Collector advisory workflows and concierge tooling
- Advanced marketplace/commerce workflows
- Rich automation systems (bulk automations, scheduled rule engines)
- AR/3D preview pipelines
- Deep notification routing logic
- Enterprise-level settings and account administration

Revisit trigger
- Only revisit after MVP quality bar is met:
  1. one clean global add flow
  2. modular edit flows
  3. reliable uploads and persistence
  4. fast preview loop
  5. visual consistency across dashboard/public profile/auth
