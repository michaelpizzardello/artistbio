ARTISTB.IO UI CRITIQUE (BRUTALLY HONEST, POST-POLISH PASS)
Date: 2026-02-14
Benchmark: Instagram creator settings/edit flows + Linktree dashboard speed/clarity.

Reality check
The product improved in this pass, but it is still not at Instagram/Linktree level.
It now looks less like a rough prototype, but still behaves like one in key workflows.

Current score (out of 10)
- Cohesion across surfaces: 5/10
- Visual hierarchy: 5/10
- Interaction trust: 5/10
- Flow clarity: 4/10
- Premium execution: 4/10
- Instagram/Linktree parity: 3/10

What is still weak (scathing version)
1) The dashboard editing model is still architecturally messy.
- The “Edit Block” overlay is a monolithic form surface pretending to be modular.
- This is the opposite of Instagram-style focused editing and Linktree-style speed-to-publish.
- It asks users to parse too much in one place and leaks implementation complexity into UX.

2) Surface quality is still inconsistent.
- Marketing/auth/public/legal now feel more coherent than before, but dashboard internals remain style-fragmented.
- Some components use tokenized semantics while others still rely on ad-hoc hardcoded values.
- Result: the app still feels partially unified, not intentionally systemized.

3) Feature trust is still fragile in important areas.
- News/Links are still local-draft only and not persisted to backend.
- Upload flows still do not expose explicit retry affordances after failure.
- Users can’t fully trust that all actions map to durable outcomes.

4) Empty/unauth states are too thin for a premium product.
- Unauth dashboard states are functional but visually low-information and emotionally flat.
- Compared to Linktree, “next best action” guidance and confidence cues are weak.

5) Public profile quality is no longer fake, but still not brand-defining.
- Removing placeholder biography/image was the right move.
- However, the public presentation still lacks distinctive editorial personality and motion polish.

What improved in this pass
- Placeholder fake profile fallback was removed; public unknown profiles now show honest unavailable state.
- Edit overlay checkboxes were replaced with consistent switch controls.
- Settings detail toggles are now stateful and persisted locally.
- Landing and login hierarchy/readability improved with clearer labels and calmer visual direction.
- Legal pages moved from obvious placeholder stubs to structured branded templates.
- Mini preview typography was normalized to reduce jagged hierarchy.

Bottom line
This is now closer to a serious MVP, but still below the “premium consumer app” bar in your own docs.
If the benchmark is Instagram + Linktree, the biggest remaining blocker is interaction model quality in edit/publish workflows, not just visual styling.

Hard priority next moves (in order)
1) Replace monolithic Edit Block overlay with true step-based create/edit flows.
2) Complete dashboard token migration and eliminate remaining ad-hoc color/type drift.
3) Persist News/Links to backend and add explicit upload retry UX.
4) Upgrade dashboard empty/unauth states with stronger orientation and trust cues.
5) Add subtle but consistent motion/state feedback across create/save/publish flows.
