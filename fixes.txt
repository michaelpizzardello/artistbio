- If code changes, stale items are removed immediately.
- Non-MVP ideas go to `non-mvp-todo.txt`.

Current code snapshot (verified)
- Global add affordance is icon-only `+` with accessibility label:
  - components/dashboard/ArtistDashboard.tsx:1823
- Preview affordance is now icon-only eye in edit contexts and floating action rail:
  - components/dashboard/ArtistDashboard.tsx:1526
  - components/dashboard/ArtistDashboard.tsx:1692
  - components/dashboard/ArtistDashboard.tsx:1815
- Shared dashboard toggle sizing has been reduced to compact switch dimensions:
  - components/dashboard/DashboardToggleSwitch.tsx:11
  - components/dashboard/DashboardToggleSwitch.tsx:15
- Home no longer duplicates Artworks/Exhibitions list previews:
  - components/dashboard/ArtistDashboard.tsx:959
- Profile editor is modular and route-based:
  - app/edit-profile/page.tsx
  - app/edit-profile/[section]/page.tsx
  - components/dashboard/EditProfileEditor.tsx
- Edit Profile now follows list-first workflow with focused section screens:
  - components/dashboard/EditProfileOverview.tsx
  - components/dashboard/EditProfileEditor.tsx
- Settings now uses grouped list-row IA with drill-in section routes:
  - components/dashboard/ArtistDashboard.tsx
  - app/app/settings/[section]/page.tsx

  - components/dashboard/EditProfileEditor.tsx:161

Structured benchmark audit (docs + Linktree/Instagram patterns)
Benchmarked against:
- docs/backend-app-design-guide.md
- docs/mobile-benchmark-implementation-guide.md
- docs/visual-quality-checklist.md
- docs/overarching-style-ui-guide.md

P0 findings (must fix for premium parity)

[x] Replace native checkbox toggles inside edit overlay with shared switch component
- Why: mixed toggle patterns break cohesion and feel non-productized versus Linktree/Instagram consistency.
- Evidence:
  - components/dashboard/ArtistDashboard.tsx
  - components/dashboard/DashboardToggleSwitch.tsx

[x] Redesign Settings screen to native list-row IA (Instagram/Linktree parity)
- Why: current settings UI is static informational cards, while benchmark apps use tappable grouped rows with clear drill-in affordance, hierarchy, and account/security prioritization.
- Evidence:
  - components/dashboard/ArtistDashboard.tsx:1005
  - app/app/settings/[section]/page.tsx
  - components/dashboard/SettingsDetailView.tsx

[x] Redesign Edit Profile surface to Instagram-style native form hierarchy
- Why: current Edit Profile relies on pill-tab navigation + decorative section card + uppercase micro-label pattern that reads dashboard-like rather than native account editing; benchmark apps prioritize simple stacked fields, row-based drill-ins, and tighter visual hierarchy.
- Evidence:
  - components/dashboard/EditProfileOverview.tsx
  - components/dashboard/EditProfileEditor.tsx:319
  - components/dashboard/EditProfileEditor.tsx:351
  - app/edit-profile/page.tsx

[ ] Break monolithic “Edit Block” overlay into step-based flows
- Why: violates progressive disclosure and one-task-per-step standards from dashboard docs and benchmark guide.
- Evidence:
  - components/dashboard/ArtistDashboard.tsx:1390
  - components/dashboard/ArtistDashboard.tsx:1415
  - components/dashboard/ArtistDashboard.tsx:1545

[ ] Replace hardcoded color-heavy styling with tokenized system in dashboard surfaces
- Why: visual cohesion drift; docs call for token discipline and no ad-hoc style drift.
- Evidence:
  - components/dashboard/ArtistDashboard.tsx
  - components/dashboard/DashboardMediaEditCard.tsx
- In progress:
  - components/dashboard/DashboardAddSheet.tsx
  - components/dashboard/DashboardBottomNav.tsx
  - components/dashboard/DashboardMoreSheet.tsx
  - components/dashboard/DashboardSectionHeader.tsx
  - components/dashboard/DashboardProfileHeader.tsx

[x] Normalize typography scale for mini preview cards to avoid one-off pixel sizes
- Why: current text size mix reads uneven and below premium benchmark polish.
- Evidence:
  - components/dashboard/ArtworksMiniPreview.tsx
  - components/dashboard/ExhibitionsMiniPreview.tsx

[x] Remove placeholder fallback content on public artist page before production release
- Why: placeholder editorial copy/image undermines trust and premium feel.
- Evidence:
  - app/[username]/page.tsx

P1 findings (important, not blocking current micro-polish pass)

[x] Make settings detail toggles stateful and persisted locally
- Why: no-op controls reduce trust and feel unfinished versus benchmark apps.
- Evidence:
  - components/dashboard/SettingsDetailView.tsx

[ ] Persist News/Links in Supabase
- Current behavior remains local draft persistence only.
- Evidence:
  - components/dashboard/ArtistDashboard.tsx:1031

[ ] Add explicit upload retry affordance in artwork/exhibition upload flows
- Current behavior shows upload progress only.
- Evidence:
  - components/dashboard/ArtistDashboard.tsx:1469
  - components/dashboard/ArtistDashboard.tsx:1635

P2 findings (defer)
- Broader token migration across marketing/auth/legal surfaces.
- Advanced micro-motion/state polish once IA/flow refactors stabilize.
